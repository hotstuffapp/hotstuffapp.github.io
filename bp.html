    <h2>Business Plan</h2>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>The media are mainly promoting big events (that have large marketing budgets), which some times are low quality, and people are not aware of the more smaller and rewarding ones.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>An app that lists upcoming events based on their real quality (value) and popularity. Let people chose their own category interests and provide them with a daily feed of interesting things to see / visit / buy.</p>
    <p>Make a list of all the events in the world and use artificial intelligence to analyze which ones provide the most value and are of high quality.</p>
    
    <h3>Business model</h3>
    <p>Create promotion packages for companies that want to raise visibility of their events / products for a larger outreach. Based on the selected package our company will promote the customers' offering via media coverage and preferential placement in the "Hotstuff" app. We can also send push notifications to our users who have opted-in for this feature.</p>

    <h3>Target market</h3>
    <p>Mass market, males and females aged 12 to 75 (6 million in Sweden alone).</p>
         
    <h3>Competitive advantage</h3>
    <p>Our advantage is that we cover all entertainment channels. There are already other popular apps but they are dedicated to covering only one entertainment channel.</p>
    <p>In the mobile app world, the retention rate is getting lower by every quarter. From 14 days in Q3 2012 to less than a day in Q4 2016. Users are installing apps but they are quickly getting uninstalled. On average a mobile user is unsing no more than 3 apps, every day. This has created a market for apps that provide more larger functionality, all-in-one apps.</p>

    <h3>Management team</h3>
    <p>As of now only the developer.</p>

    <h3>Financial summary</h3>
    <p>Currently have invested 800 hours of development, Android Play Store license, Apple App Store license and domain name.</p>

    <h3>Funding required</h3>
    <p>300.000k sek for a runway of 10 months.</p>
